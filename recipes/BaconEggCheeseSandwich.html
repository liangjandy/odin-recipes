<h2>Ingrediants</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 slices bacon</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons butter, divided</li>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 pinch freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    <li>1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>4 slices bread</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Place bacon in a nonstick skillet and cook over medium-high heat, 
        turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 7 minutes. Drain 
        bacon slices on paper towels. Remove bacon to a drip line tray. Drain 
        off bacon grease for another use. Wash out the skillet.
    </li>
    <li>Whisk eggs with salt and pepper in a small bowl until frothy.</li>
    <li>Melt 2 teaspoons butter in the nonstick skillet over medium heat. 
        Pour in beaten eggs; let cook for 30 seconds. Lift the edges of the 
        omelet so that the uncooked egg runs under the cooked edges and comes 
        into contact with the hot skillet. Shake and tilt the skillet to move 
        the uncooked egg. Repeat until the top is set, about 3 minutes; reduce 
        heat to low. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Run a spatula around the entire omelet to loosen from the skillet. 
        Carefully turn the omelet over so buttered side of bread is in contact 
        with the skillet. Cook until bread is toasted and golden, about 2 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Using the spatula, fold in edges of omelet to align with sides of the bread. 
        Cut omelet along center with the spatula to form 2 sandwiches. Butter 2 
        remaining bread slices with remaining butter; place butter side up on each 
        sandwich. Turn sandwiches; cook until golden, about 2 minutes more. Serve 
        and enjoy immediately!
